# Sentiment-analysis-chatbot
A simple sentiment analysis chatbot built using Python. It uses both TextBlob and VADER (from NLTK) to analyze the sentiment of user input. Based on the polarity score, the chatbot classifies text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. This project demonstrates basic natural language processing for text classification tasks.
